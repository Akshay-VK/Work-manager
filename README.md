# Work-manager

## In simple terms...

Work manager is a work manager website which uses the users Google Account to Sign in and store all data. It uses Firebase There are multiple sections in it:

 - Entry
 - Ideas
 - Assignments/ Homeworks/ Tests
 - Overdue/Urgent
 - Notes

The entry section is for making all Ideas, Assignments/Homeworks, Overdue/Urgent entries.

Assignments update automatically ith the date.

I am building my self in 3 versions: 

 - React
 - Angular
 - Vanilla Javascript



I am starting with the Vanilla JS version, which is this one, as I am not that familiar with React or Angular and I am using this project to learn them. üòä


## Components

This website will be using Firebase for storage and authentication. It will use the user's Google account for authentication. 

It will use Firestore for storage.

There will be no sign up process (for now).

If you are signed in it will show your lists or else it will show the website's description.

### Ideas

Ideas will be a bright colour. And that is pretty much it. üòÅ

### Assignments/Homeworks and Overdue/Urgent

I'm actually making this website as I myself have a lot of trouble keeping track of tests and assignments.

Assignments will have a entry for a date as well because, once the date is crossed it will automatically become urgent.

### Notes

The notes will have a part in the bottom of the page will show a description of the specific item when clicked on.

The description will also be entered by the user.

#### This website is sill being developed.
